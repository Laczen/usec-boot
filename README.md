# uSECboot
uSECboot is a libary of routines to create a secure bootloader.

Images booted by uSECboot are signed with a Ed25519 signature. Ed25519 is a high-performance and secure digital signature algorithm that uses the EdDSA standard and the Curve25519 elliptic curve. It is known for its speed in both signing and verification, its strong security against various attacks, and its simple implementation, which minimizes developer error. Ed25519 is a popular choice for modern applications like blockchains and for tasks such as securing SSH connections. The Ed25519 algorithm used in uSECboot is implemented by [monocypher](https://monocypher.org/). A slight modification to monocypher is applied to create a smaller bootloader.

Images booted by uSECboot are prepended with a header that consists of TLV (tag length value) items. Three vital TLV's are used to make the images secure:
1. A hash (sha512) of the firmware,
2. A signed public key,
3. A signature calculated over the TLV's. This signature can be verified using the provided signed public key. The signature is added as the last TLV of the header.

Images are only allowed to boot when the signed public key is valid (it's signature is OK), the signature is valid and the hash matches.

## The signed public key
Each image for uSECboot is provided with a signed public key, what is it and why is it added. The signed public key is a public key that is signed using what is known as a root public key. This root public key is built into the bootloader. This root public key is used to sign a new public key. This allows uSECboot to verify that the provided public key in the signed public key TLV is created by a trusted source as only a trusted source has access to the root public key.

Separating the public key that is used to sign a firmware from the root public key (i.e. not signing the firmware with the root public key) has some advantages:
1. As the root key is not used for signing images the chance of a leaked root key is reduced,
2. It enables the creation of a set of public keys that are no longer trusted and thus should no longer be accepted as valid public keys. uSECboot checks if a public keys belongs to a set of rejected public keys and does not accept any signatures using these public keys.

## Creating a bootloader using uSECboot
uSECboot is not a bootloader, it is a small library to create a secure bootloader. Altough there are some provided bootloader implementation it is encouraged to develop your custom secure bootloader that exactly fits your needs.

The interface between the bootloader and uSECboot is setup by creating the following structure for a "slot" that contains firmware:

```c
struct usecboot_slotapi {
	int (*prep)(const struct usecboot_slot *slot);
	int (*read)(const struct usecboot_slot *slot, uint32_t start, void *data,
		  size_t len);
	void (*boot)(const struct usecboot_slot *slot);
	void (*clean)(const struct usecboot_slot *slot);
};

struct usecboot_slot {
	void *ctx;
	enum usecboot_slotstate state;
	struct usecboot_slotapi *api;
};
```
